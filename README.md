# NewsApp
A prctice project by DevProjects...

A mobile app to consume the News API and display a list of news articles. Clicking one of the news articles will open the news article within the app.


# Requirements

When the user opens the app, they should see a list of news articles. Each news article should have the following details:

Source of the article (e.g. TechCrunch)
Author of the article (e.g. Mark Johnson)
Title of the article
Subtitle of the article - this shouldn't exceed 2 lines and should be truncated if it does
Published date in the format MM/DD/YYYY (e.g. 12/02/2020)
Image for the article provided by the News API
When the user clicks on a news article, open a new screen in the app and show the news article in that screen using the URL provided by the News API. It's important that you avoid opening the news article in a separate web browser and taking the user away from the app. This ensures that your mobile app provides a more immersive experience to the user.
